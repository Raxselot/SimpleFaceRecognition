This is a Human-Friendly Face Recognition System that helps identify people from video streams in real-time.

All it does is open your webcam, scan for faces, match them against previously saved faces, and display the person's name if a match is found (or "Unknown" if not). You can easily add new faces by providing an image and name.

The goal was to create a simple face recognition system that simulates a friendly interaction, recognizing faces in a more intuitive and user-friendly way.
